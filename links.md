# WEEK 01

1. [Introduction to Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
For those of you who are new and want to know more about the operating system, you can listen 
to the explanation there. OS is used to command and run the device it has, to make it fit as desired.

2. [What is Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)<br>
A shared web hosting service for software development projects using the Git version control 
system and internet hosting services.

3. [Basic Understanding of Virtual Machine](https://www.goldenfast.net/blog/virtual-machine-adalah/)<br>
With a virtual machine, you can run applications, programs, or scripts on these devices 
virtually as if you were using a different device

# WEEK 02

4. [The Importance of Cyber Security](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-cyber-security/)<br>
Organizations transmit sensitive data across networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, 
and cyber security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to 
process or store it.

5. [C Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lQEunpmtRA)<br>
One of the advantages of the C programming language is that it is portable. C language has many compilers 
for almost all types of processors, so C language can be used for almost all platforms.

# WEEK 03

6. [File Systems in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
A file is a sequence of bits, bytes, or records whose meaning is defined by the file creator and user. 
Every File has a logical location where they are located for storage and retrieval.

7. [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/filesystem-hierarchy-standard)<br>
A consensus on how directories should be organized and which files should be stored where, so that 
distributions could have a single reference point from which to work

# WEEK 04

8. [Static and Dynamic Libraries in Linux](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)<br>
A library is a collection of pre-compiled pieces of code called functions. The library contains common 
functions and together, they form a package called — a library. For programmers, libraries provide reusable 
functions, data structures, classes and so forth.

9. [Difference between Global and Local Variable](https://www.guru99.com/local-vs-global-variable.html)<br>
Variable is a name assign to a storage area that the program can manipulate. A variable type determines the 
size and layout of the variable’s memory. It also determines the range of values which need to be stored 
inside that memory and nature of operations that can be applied to that variable

# WEEK 05

10. [Virtual Memory - Oerating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is 
actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM

11. [Memory Allocation Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves 
processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution

# WEEK 06

12. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics/05%3A_Process_Synchronization/5.1%3A_Introduction_to_Concurrency)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of a set of multiple instruction sequences at the same time. This occurs when 
there are several process threads running in parallel. These threads communicate with the other threads/processes 
through a concept of shared memory or through message passing

13. [Get to Know Threads](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html)<br>
A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, consisting of a program counter, a stack, and a set of registers, 
( and a thread ID. ). Traditional ( heavyweight ) processes have a single thread of control - There is one 
program counter, and one sequence of instructions that can be carried out at any given time

# WEEK 07
14. [Synchronization Process Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes 
can have access to the same shared data and resources. This can lead to the inconsistency of shared data. So 
the change made by one process not necessarily reflected when other processes accessed the same shared data.

15. [Introduction to Semaphores](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/introduction-to-semaphores)<br>
it is basically a synchronizing tool and is accessed only through two low standard atomic operations, wait and 
signal designated by P(S) and V(S) respectively. In very simple words, the semaphore is a variable that can 
hold only a non-negative Integer value, shared between all the threads, with operations wait and signal
